```
bash
git clone https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory

Move the training configs from `train` folder to `LLaMA-Factory/examples/train_full`.

```
bash
mv modelcitizens/train/config_llama.yaml  LLaMA-Factory/examples/train_full

Download the training data from huggingface. 

```
Python 
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("modelcitizens/modelcitizens")
